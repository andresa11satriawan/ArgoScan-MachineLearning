## About
Crop diseases pose a significant challenge in agriculture, leading to substantial reductions in crop yields and quality, while also placing considerable economic pressure on farmers, especially in resource-limited and rural regions. Small-scale farmers frequently find it difficult to detect early signs of disease, as traditional diagnostic methods often require expert intervention, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and hard to access. This lack of timely and accurate disease detection results in inadequate treatment, crop losses, and financial difficulties, exacerbating crop management challenges throughout the growing season. AgroScan tackles these issues by utilizing machine learning and mobile technology to offer an accessible, real-time disease diagnosis tool that can help mitigate crop losses and support farmers' livelihoods.
